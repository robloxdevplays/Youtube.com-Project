# Introduction

This is the first ever coding project I did with the intent on learning HTML and CSS. This is a copy of Youtube.com's design, with the videos actually linked.

# Things I learned with this
1. Different HTML Elements
2. CSS styling techniques
3. CSS Positions (Flexbox, grid, nested layouts, absolute & relative)
4. Media quaries
5. Pseudo Classes, transitions, and much more.
